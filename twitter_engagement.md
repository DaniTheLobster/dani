# Dani Twitter Engagement Log

## 2026-02-06 20:03 EST - Mission Attempt
**Status:** BLOCKED

### Attempted Actions
- Tried to access twitter.com via browser automation
- Gateway service restarted
- Browser control unavailable - requires Chrome extension tab attachment

### Blockers
- Browser automation requires OpenClaw Chrome extension to be active on a tab
- No connected tab for profile "chrome"
- OpenClaw profile also unresponsive

### Recommendation
To complete Twitter engagement missions:
1. Open Chrome
2. Navigate to twitter.com
3. Click the OpenClaw Browser Relay extension icon (badge should show ON)
4. Re-run this task

Or alternatively:
- Use Twitter API v2 with bearer token instead of browser automation
- Pre-schedule tweets via API without real-time engagement
