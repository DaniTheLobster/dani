## 2026-02-08
- **Time:** 8:02 PM ET
- **Username:** curnpoo
- **Status:** BLOCKED - Technical Limitations

### Attempted Actions

#### 1. Check Replies to @curnpoo Posts (Last 24h)
**Attempted:**
- Web search for @curnpoo recent activity
- Browser navigation to x.com/curnpoo

**Blockers:**
- Brave Search API rate limited (429 errors after 2 queries)
- Twitter/X requires JavaScript execution - web_fetch returns "Something went wrong" message
- Browser automation: Chrome extension relay not connected to any tab
- No direct Twitter API access via available tools

---

#### 2. Community Engagement Targets (Planned)
**Communities Identified via Search:**

**OpenClaw Community:**
- @openclaw main account (100k+ GitHub stars milestone, rebranded from Clawd/Moltbot)
- Latest release: OpenClaw 2026.1.30 with Kimi K2.5, MiniMax OAuth, Telegram improvements
- GitHub discussions active at github.com/OpenClaw/OpenClaw/discussions

**ElevenLabs Community:**
- Recent: CEO Staniszewski at Web Summit Doha discussing voice as next AI interface
- r/ElevenLabs on Reddit has active discussions about promo codes, voice model deprecations
- Voice Agents platform launch in January 2026

**AI Automation/Tool Builders:**
- n8n, Zapier alternatives community
- Script builders on GitHub/Reddit
- *Search rate limited before able to find specific posts*

---

#### 3. Engagement Plan (Pending Access)
**My Replies to Handle:**
- [PENDING]: Check notifications for questions about OpenClaw setup
- [PENDING]: Reply to compliments with thanks + reciprocation
- [PENDING]: Acknowledge constructive feedback

**Community Engagement Targets:**
- [@openclaw]: New release post → Like + reply with genuine tech observation

- [AI builder community]: Automation post with technical depth → Like + add tip

### Notes

**Technical Constraints:**
1. Brave Search API: Rate limited (429) - plan: Free, quota: 2000/mo, currently at 200+
2. Twitter/X: JavaScript-dependent, blocks headless access
3. Browser automation: Requires Chrome extension attachment (user action needed)
4. No bird CLI or Twitter API tokens configured

**Solutions to Explore:**
- Request user attach Chrome extension to X.com tab for browser automation
- Consider Twitter API v2 free tier application
- Alternative: Monitor via Reddit/GitHub discussions (accessible via web_fetch)

**Patterns Observed:**
- OpenClaw community very active (100k+ stars milestone, 2M visitors/week during rebrand)
- ElevenLabs pushing voice-as-interface narrative at conferences
- AI agent tools seeing strong adoption in automation workflows

---

### Next Attempt
**When:** Browser Chrome extension attached OR Twitter API v2 access configured
**Current Priority:** Complete task requires either:
- User clicking OpenClaw Chrome extension icon on x.com tab
- OR granting Twitter API access tokens
- OR waiting for Brave Search rate limit reset (likely daily/weekly)
